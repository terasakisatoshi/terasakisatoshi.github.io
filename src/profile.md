# Name

- Satoshi Terasaki

- I graduaced from graduate school (Master's degree in Math). I spent 6 years as a software engineer. For the 2 years I learned C/C++ through self-study which was SOOOO tough for me because I had NO experience in software development at all prior to new graduate. After that I found Python and JuliaLang. They are very suitable for me. So, I prefer to use them. 
- I like to make tools that visualize data regarding topics in Math. I think JuliaLang is the best to accomplish them.
# Jobs

- I'm currently making applications based on Deep Learning as R&D by reading some articles and reproducing their results. 
- You can check [my GitHub account](https://github.com/terasakisatoshi) to see what I did in the past.
- I hope to be of help by implementing software through collaboration with researchers.
